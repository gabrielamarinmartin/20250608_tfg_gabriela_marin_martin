This repository contains the code used to handle missing data in Alzherimer's disease dataset using an imputation method based on Latent Variable Models (LVMs). It compares the performance of LVM-based imputation against the state-of-the-art techniques, and assesses the effectiveness of the imputed datasets within a regression framework.
